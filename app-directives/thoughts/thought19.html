<h5>Dinner Routine (Electronic Fast and Storytelling)</h5>
<p>Stressed? What better way to settle down than to enjoy a meal with family or friends. </p>
<p>For centuries the highlight of peoples days was centered around the dinner table a place to enjoy food,
companionship, connection, stories, laughter, etc. </p>
<p>In our pursuit of more stuff we have created busy lifestyles for ourselves that make dinner together
even more challenging. </p>
<p>Our recommendation is to rekindle the family dinner for at least 2 nights per week. </p>
<p>Our recommendation is to engage the entire family in preparation and cleanup. </p>

<p>In an effort to rekindle conversation we recommend that all dinner guests put their cell phones into a
basket and that basket is removed from the dining room. </p>
<p>Storytelling is part of being human but is becoming a lost art. Our teenagers really dislike being asked
about their day. To keep it interesting we suggest that storytelling begins with the parents. The parents
should talk about the highlights of their day, 1 thing that they are grateful for, and 1 thing that didn’t go
as planned during the day. Please don’t fear that your stories aren’t good enough to share. Please don’t
feel that your stories need to top the person who told theirs immediately before you. </p>
<p><b>Tip:</b>Practice today. Make it fun. You will get better over time.</p>
<p><b>Action:</b>For the next week practice your dinner routine. Observe how you feel and how your family feels.
    Write your observations down in your spiral notebook.</p>
