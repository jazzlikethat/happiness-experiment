<h5>What Truly Matters</h5>
<p>We are all really busy. But what are we busy doing? What are we working on that is so important? </p>
<p>Have you stopped recently even for a few minutes to think about what matters the most to you?</p>
<p>Have you written those things down? </p>
<p>Do it now! Write down the 3-5 things that really matter to you. </p>

<p>Now, please take just a minute and while looking over you list ask yourself how much time you spent
working on those things today? The past week? The past month? </p>
<p>If you are like us you may have noticed that you are not spending very much time at all on the things
that matter most. </p>
<p>As Dr. Stephen Covey said, "It doesn’t matter how fast we climb the ladder if it is on the wrong wall." </p>
<p>Is it somehow surprising to you that our most prized relationships fall apart when we don’t have
conversations? It is surprising that your health has gotten away from you when you don’t exercise
enough and eat poorly? </p>

<p>Make time in your life for the things that truly matter. Be a farmer of these things – till the soil, plant
the seeds, fertilize, water, weed and then reap the harvest. </p>


<p><b>Tip:</b>This exercise can be even more powerful if you create a collage for yourself of the things that really
    matter.</p>
<p><b>Action:</b>Make a list of the things that matter the most to you. Keep this list close and look at it every day.
    Then ask yourself the question – How much time did I spend working on the things that are most
    important to me today? What can I do better tomorrow?</p>
