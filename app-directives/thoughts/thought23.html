<h5>The Goldilocks’ Zone</h5>
<p> Goldilocks’ zone, what the heck is that? In the old nursery rhyme Goldilocks and the 3
    Bears. Goldilocks was lost in forest and after wandering around for hours she stumbled
    upon a small house in the woods that belonged to the 3 bears. As luck would have it for
    goldilocks the bears were away when she knocked on the door and when no one answered
    she let herself in and found 3 bowls of porridge on the dining table. She tried the first on and
    it was too hot, the second one was too cold, but the third one was just right, so she ate it all
    up. In life most of the things that we encounter have a sweet spot just like in the nursery
    rhyme. Perhaps the sweet spot is temperature, time, number of choices, etc. </p>
    
    <p> Life has a way of leading us to believe that more is better, but sometimes it is not. As you
    think about loading up your day with happiness too much can be a bad thing. We feel like
    we have to do something and it reduces the effectiveness. Too much gratification sure,
    think about the place where everyone is telling you good job, even when some of the time
    you know that you haven’t done a good job. The gratitude isn’t authentic, its just lip service. </p>
    
    <p> Too much choice? Yes, too much choice can be debilitating. It used to be easy to make a
    choice of what salad dressing to purchase, but now with 150 choices sometime I just shut
    down. The same goes for information. Too much information and its is hard to find the
    information that truly matters, the result is noise and chaos. </p>
