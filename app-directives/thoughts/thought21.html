<h5>Ending your day</h5>
<p> The world is a 24/7 place, humans are not, we need to sleep. We need to recharge. To
    sleep well we need to set ourselves up for success. We recommend a bed time routine that
    is consistent.</p>
    â€‹
<p><b>Tip:</b>Practice today. Make it fun. Reward yourself after you finish. You will get better over time.</p>
<p><b>Action:</b>For the next week practice reflection, it is hard because you are tired at the end of your day.
    Fight through it. Observe how you feel and how your family feels. Write your observations down in your
    spiral notebook.</p>
