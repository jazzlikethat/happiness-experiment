<h5>Pay it Forward</h5>
<p>What is paying it forward? It is doing something nice for someone without expecting anything in return.
    Perhaps you have seen the movie or have experienced someone’s unexpected generosity. </p>
    <p>There is a pile of evidence that proves that doing nice things for people makes us happier. </p>
    <p> What are some ways to pay it forward? </p>
<ul>
    <li>Hold the door for someone</li>
    <li>If you shop at Aldi’s give someone your cart when you are finished (save them $0.25 and a trip
        to the cart corral)</li>
    <li>Buy random people in line at your favorite coffee shop a coffee by giving the cashier $10 and
        asking them to buy peoples’ coffee’s for them anonymously (hint: you should start with at least
        2 people behind you to increase the surprise)</li>
    <li>Pass along a book that you have purchased to a friend who you think would enjoy it and ask
        them to do the same.</li>    
</ul>    
<p><b>Tip:</b>Practice today. Make it fun.</p>
<p><b>Action:</b>For the next day practice paying it forward at least 1 time per day. Observe the reaction in the
    person you are paying it forward to. Observe how they feel and how you feel. Write your observations
    down in your spiral notebook.</p>
