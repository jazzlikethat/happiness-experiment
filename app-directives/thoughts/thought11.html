<h5>Your Day Plan</h5>
<p>Does your day control you or do you control your day?</p>
<p>A calendar is one of the oldest and most powerful tools that you can use to help with the fight against
    your day controlling you.</p>
<p>We recommend that you fill in your following daily calendar at the end of each working day during your
    summary session. Put in your most important tasks and events.</p>
<p>As you fill in your calendar leave spaces or block out “me” time. Time that you need to complete the
    your most important tasks.</p>
<p>For example: If you are a morning person you may block out the time from 9-11am for a “meeting” or
    some other tag to reserve that time for yourself.</p>    
<p><b>Action:</b>This evening fill in your calendar for tomorrow. Blocking out 1 time slot for yourself to get your
    most important thing done. Record your results in your spiral notebook.</p>
