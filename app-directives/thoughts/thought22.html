<h5>Sleep</h5>
<p>Sleep is one of the most overlooked foundations of happiness. Think of the last time you
    were truly rested. How did you feel? Energetic, Alive? Now think about the last time you
    were sleep deprived. How did you feel? If your like me you felt sluggish, lethargic, easily
    agitated. </p>
    <p>Science tells us that we need between 7-9 hours of sleep per night. How are you setting
    yourself up for success? </p>
    <p>Do you keep your phone by your bed? </p>
    <p>Do you keep your room dark? </p>
    <p>Are you using electronics before bed? </p>
    <p>Do you check your phone during the night? </p>
    <p>Arianna Huffington’s company Thrive Global has created an amazing resource on their
    website filled with articles and helpful tips. </p>
    <p>Start tonight. Turn off your electronics an hour before bed. Eliminate all your electronics
    from your bedroom. Read a good book before bed. Use an alarm clock to wake yourself up.
    It is helpful if you go to bed and wake up at the same time everyday to get into circadian
    rhythms and daily flow. For me I make it a habit to be in bed by 930 to that I can wake up
    rested at 5am. </p>
