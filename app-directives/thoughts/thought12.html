<h5>Exercise</h5>
<p>Perhaps you have heard the expression that "The physical drives the mental."</p>
<p>There is little question that the quality of your life has a lot to do with your physical condition and your
beliefs about your condition.</p>
<p>We believe in a blend of exercises that encompass: Strength, flexibility, agility, speed, and endurance.</p>
<p>Life works against you. Many of our jobs require us to sit for extended periods hunched over a keyboard.</p>
<p>In our relaxation time we lounge on the couch watching TV. Speaking of TV here is a scary statistic, in a
recent survey it was found that the average American watches the equivalent of 16 years of TV in their
lifetime.</p>
<p>Walk every day. 10,000 steps + </p>
<p>Strength training – minimum of 3 times per week.</p>
<p>Flexibility training – minimum of 3 times per week and then daily during 20 minute work bursts.</p>
<p>Endurance training – minimum of 3 times per week.</p>
<p>Speed training – minimum of 3 times per week.</p>
<p>Please note that no times are given each workout. The duration is up to you and must be worked into
your daily balance. Trainings can be combined into a single session.</p>
