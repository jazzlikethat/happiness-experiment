<h5>Building your daily happiness routine</h5>
<p>Thank you again for taking the time to complete the starting questionnaires. We promise that they will be valuable as we compare our progress throughout the program.</p>
<p>The core of the Happiness Experiment is inspiring you and helping you develop a daily happiness routine. This routine is very much like building a physical fitness regiment for your yourself. We will start slow and build as the program progresses. We will experiment with new things, keeping what you find effective and discarding the rest.</p>

<p>Why 2 daily questions?</p>
<p>To get us in the habit of thinking about happiness on a daily basis</p>
<p>To track our progress.</p>
<p>To help us consider why we score our days the way we do.</p>
<p>How does it work?</p>
<p>Everyday we ask you to answer 2 questions. This can be done once in the morning and then once at the end of the day or you can answer both questions at the end of the day. Please remember that this is your happiness routine.</p>
<p>The first question: How excited were you to start your day? Please use a score between 0 (worst morning ever) to 10 (best morning ever).</p>
<p>Second question: Was is a good day? Please use a score between 0 (worst day ever) to 10 (best day ever).</p>
<p>As you fill in your 2 daily scores, please consider and reflect on why you scored the day the way you did. Add pluses and minuses in the rows below.</p>
<p>Each row can be scored from 3 minuses (1 star) to 3 pluses (6 stars) depending on the degree of positive or negative experience.</p>
<p>Also please understand that the this scoring is completely subjective (meaning that is all up to you), there is no comparison or judgment. Our intent is that you compare yourself only to yourself and use this tool to chart progress. With that said if you artificially score yourself, you will only be fooling yourself and we believe strongly that “All progress starts with the truth.”</p>
<p>As the program progresses we will add daily activities to the daily routine.</p>
