<h5>Nutrition</h5>
<p>We are what we eat. Literally.</p>
<p>Our most basic equation: weight (gain/loss) = Calories in – Calories burned. </p>
<p>1 pound = approximately 3500 calories.</p>
<p>The average person burns about 2000 calories per day.</p>
<p>The quality of the calories matters. Your health is tied to the nutritional density of the foods that you
eat. "Nutritional density = nutrients/calories" Dr. Joel Furman</p>
<p>Our food also has a significant affect on our health in addition to our weight. The right foods contain all
the nutrients that our bodies need to build healthy immune systems.</p>
<p>Research has shown that sugar is one of the most addictive substances on the planet. Is it any wonder
that sugar shows up in the vast majority of the foods that we eat. For the most part the experts agree
that we need to avoid processed sugars and other simple carbohydrates, highly processed foods and
overly salty foods. What does this mean?</p>
<ul>
    <li>Vegetables are better for you than pizza.</li>
    <li>Water is better for you than soda.</li>
</ul>

<p>We believe in a balanced diet. Get the 90% right and cheat when you need to. If you cheat too much the
    scale will let you know. Speaking of scales. We recommend weighing yourself once per week, when you
    first wake up on a midweek morning.</p>
    
<p>The time to control what you eat is in the grocery store. We have proven it over and over to ourselves
that if I buy it and it is in our house, eventually our willpower will break and we will eat it. So if you don’t
want to eat ice cream, soda, potato chips and cookies for a while, then don’t buy them. Also don’t buy
the ingredients, like a box of brownie mix. You will have a weak moment you will eat it if it is in your
house.</p>


<p><b>Tip:</b>Find and follow a nutritional expert online or locally. Some of our favorites include Dr. Oz, Dr. Joel
    Furman, Dr. Walter Willett, Whole 30.</p>
<p><b>Action:</b>Start your understanding of food and calories consumed today. We recommend using a calorie
    counter app such as myfitnesspal or better yet using a calorie budget and laying out all your food for the
    day ahead of time.</p>
