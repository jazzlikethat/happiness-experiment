<h5>The Morning Routine</h5>
<p>The first question that we ask you to answer each day is “How excited are you to start your day?”
    Research has shown that if you start your day poorly it is difficult for most people to have a good day.</p>
<p>How did you wake up this morning?</p>
<p>If you are like most people you leave how your day starts up to chance. The alarm goes off, it surprises
    you, still feeling sleepy you roll over and hit the snooze button. In 10 minutes the alarm goes off again,
    slightly more awake you more seriously ponder getting out of bed but find the alternative more
    satisfying so you hit the snooze button one more time. This time you realize that time is now short and
    that you must rush to get out the door on time.</p>
<p>So you either didn’t have a plan or failed to execute your plan and immediately lost control of your day.</p>
<p>In the words of happiness expert Ben Franklin "Failing to plan is planning to fail."</p>

<p>From more modern perspective General McCraven in his book “Make your Bed” suggests that
    starting the day with 1 single task done well, tee’s your day up for success. If you haven’t seen
    the commencement speech that he gave a few years back at the University of Texas we highly
    recommend it, 6 minutes that just might change your life. Here is the link: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6OoCaGsz94">Inspiring: Change the
    World by Making Your Bed - by Admiral William McRaven </a> if you have a bit more time we recommend
    watching the full 19 minute version easily found with a google search.</p>
<p><b>Tip:</b>Develop a morning routine which allows you to start the day on a positive note and keep control of
    your day for as long as possible. We like the following suggestions:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Start your day with a countdown – “5-4-3-2-1 blastoff</li>
        <li>Start your day with meditation</li>
        <li>Start your day with exercise</li>
        <li>Start your day at the same time each morning, going to bed approximately 8 hours before your
            alarm time.</li>
        <li>Do not start your day by checking your phone. Remember the idea is for you to control your day
            for as long as possible.</li>
    </ul>
<p><b>Action:</b>Practice your morning routine. Experiment with different methods. Write your observations in
    your spiral notebook.</p>
