<p><b>Tip:</b>Write down 3 affirmations on sticky notes and put them up on your bedroom or bathroom mirror.</p>
<p><b>Action:</b>Practice your affirmations saying them out loud as your look at yourself in the mirror.
    Experiment with different affirmations. Write your observations in your spiral notebook.</p>
<p>Note: this is going to feel ridiculous at first, power through, start short and progressively add time each
    day. We recommend that you strive for a minimum of 2 minutes of genuine affirmation as part of your
    morning routine. As an added bonus add affirmations to your bedtime routine as well.</p>
