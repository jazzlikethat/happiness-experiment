<h5>Catch People Doing Good</h5>
<p>As humans we are social beings, we crave and need connection with others. We need the feeling of
    belonging to something bigger that just ourselves. This can be difficult with the negative self image
    caused by the daily beatdown of negative information and quick criticism. </p>
    <p>Why are we always so quick to criticize and judge? Is it because we want to compare ourselves to the
    people around us and prove our superiority? Our value? </p>
    
    <p>I like to imagine this picture of 2 buckets â€“ The first bucket is for the positives in your day, the second is
    for the negatives. </p>
    <p>Think of your average day, where would you guess most of your inputs go? </p>
    <p>What if you could reverse this and fill up the positive bucket with 10x more inputs than the negative
    bucket? What if the criticism turned into compliments and praise. </p>
    <p>Now I am not talking about everyone gets a trophy here. What I am talking about is catching people
    doing good. In order to catch someone doing good they have to be doing something good and you have
    observe the good deed. </p>

<p><b>Tip:</b>Hopefully this is a lot easier than catching fish. Make it fun.</p>
<p><b>Action:</b>For the next day focus on catching people doing good, compliment and praise them for their
    good deeds. Observe the reaction in the person you are complimenting. Observe how you feel. Write
    your observations down in your spiral notebook.</p>
