<h5>Fear Setting</h5>
<p>“Show me your friends and I will show you your future.” Anonymous </p>
<p>“We are the average of the 5 people that we spend the most time with.” Jim Rohn </p>

<p>Think about this for a minute. Now think about the 5 people you spend the most time with. </p>
<p>What do you want out of life? </p>
<p>Are these 5 people helping you get there? Do they lift you up or drag you down? </p>
<p>I challenge you to look deep go beyond the superficial exterior. </p>
Think about the 5 people you would like to spend the most time with if it could be anybody
on the planet. Why did you choose these 5 people. </p>
<p>This may be the most important thought exercise of the 29 why? Meaningful relationships
and personal growth are 2 of the most important factors in living a good life. </p>

<p><b>Action:</b>Write down the 5 people that you spend the most time with. Then write down the 5
    people that you would like to spend the most time with and why. Write your observations
    down in your spiral notebook.</p>
