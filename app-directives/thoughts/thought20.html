<h5>Reflection</h5>
<p>We do hundreds of things every day, but they just all seems to blend together. We lose
    track of all the good things that have happened and all the good things that are in our life,
    instead we focus on just one or two negative experiences or frustrations. </p>
    
    <p>Take time at the end of each day to reflect on the good that has happened in your day, write
    or express gratitude and appreciation for those good things, good people good things in
    your life.<p>
    â€‹
<p><b>Tip:</b>Practice today. Make it fun. Reward yourself after you finish. You will get better over time.</p>
<p><b>Action:</b>For the next week practice reflection, it is hard because you are tired at the end of your day.
    Fight through it. Observe how you feel and how your family feels. Write your observations down in your
    spiral notebook.</p>
