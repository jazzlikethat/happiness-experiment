<h5>The Compound Interest Theory of Life</h5>
<p> Einstein said that “Compound interest is the eighth wonder of the world. He who
    understands it, earns it… he who doesn't… pays it.” What is compound interest? It is the
    idea that if I save money today it will be worth more in the future. As an example If I save
    $100 and put in the bank earning 2% interest in 1 year it will be worth $102. In 2 years it will
    be worth 104.04 (102 * 1.02), in 3 years it will be worth $106.13. The amount that the
    money appreciates every year increases. Over time those increase become quite large. For
    example, our $100 becomes $269 in 50 years. The bank pays a low interest rate compared
    to other investments because it is safe. Your money is federally insured. There is very little
    risk that you won’t be able to get your money back.</p>
    <p> What happens if we invest our money differently. Lets say that I take that $100 and I invest
    it in the stock market in an index fund that models the performance of the S+P 500 (an
    index of the 500 largest companies in the US). On average the stock market has returned
    8% a year for the past 100 years. There is certainly no guarantee that it will return 8% going
    forward, it could be more or it could be less but for conversational purposes lets use 8% in
    our calculations. $100 becomes $108 in a year, $116.64, $125.97 after 3 years and $4,690
    after 50 years.</p>
    <p> Wow, $4,690 that is quite a difference compared to $269.</p>
    <p> The 2 main takeaways are:</p>
    <ul>
    
      <li> 	If we really want something in the future we should start investing today. </li>
      <li> Our future return will be higher if we are willing to accept some risk. </li>
    <p> It is our theory that compound interest applies to every aspect of your life. Your mindset,
    physical self, mental self, emotional self, spiritual self, and energy. Compound interest also
    applies to your wealth, relationships, experiences, time autonomy, community (service) and
    impact. Compound interest also plays into your stress and overall life balance. </p>
    <p> What areas of your life are you investing in? </p>
    <p> How much risk are you taking? </p>
    <p> Is it good risk? How do you know this to be true? </p>
    
    <p> Perhaps this is why “Life favors the Bold.”
<p><b>Tip:</b>Think about compound interest and how it applies to certain areas of your life. Think
    about what you should be investing in: fitness, learning, emotional health, spirit… Practice
    today. Make it fun. Reward yourself after you finish. You will get better over time.</p>
