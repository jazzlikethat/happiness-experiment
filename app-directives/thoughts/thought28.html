<h5>Money and Happiness</h5>
<p>We are all raised to believe that Money will buy us happiness, so money becomes our
primary pursuit in life. Let me ask you a question, “Are the wealthiest people that you know
the happiest people that you know?” In my case it almost seems like the complete opposite.
Some of the happiest people that I know have next to no money but they do have purpose,
relationships, experiences, and contribute to the community.</p>

<p>Ben also said that “A penny saved is a penny earned” and “Remember that time is money.”
Ben is famous for his frugality.</p>
<p>I have come to believe that money is an accelerant, kind of like gasoline. If you are doing
good and want to make it go faster, throw some money at it. If you are doing bad and want
to make it go faster, throw some money on it.</p>
<p>Ihave also come to believe that there is a goldilocks zone for money. We need to have
enough to cover the basic necessities of life, but beyond that point it reaches the point of
diminishing returns.</p>
<p><b>Action:</b>Write down your views on money. Write down all the things that you want and how
    much they cost. Think about whether those things truly matter and are going to bring you
    lasting happiness. Think about the concept of frugality. Being frugal can be quite fun.
    Buying things that you need for less money can become a game. Try to find a way to either
    eliminate the purchase of an item you don’t need or purchase an item that you do need for
    less money. Write down your notes in your spiral notebook.</p>
