<h5>What is Happiness ?</h5>
<p><b>Tip:</b>You are the expert in your own happiness. No one can take that away from you.</p>
<p><b>Action:</b>Smile. Purposely smile every time that you feel gloomy. Purposefully smile when you cross someoneâ€™s path, notice the reaction. Write your observations in your spiral notebook.</p>
<p>We believe that Happiness is the scoreboard for life. All of life's details role up into how you answer
    the question "How happy am I?"; Happiness is what we are all pursuing. Happiness is life's scoreboard
    just like points are in a football game. Our opponent is who we were yesterday. Our won-loss record is
    our cumulative daily performance. We could have happiness statistics. And there could be fantasy
    happiness leagues. Ok, perhaps we are getting carried away but the point is that if we question and dive
    deep into our personal happiness, we are much more likely to live the life we want.</p>
<p>"All of us want to be happy, even if we don't admit it openly or choose to cloak our desire in different
    words." Sonja Lyubomirsky</p>
<p>That no other word in the English language better describes what we are looking for in life. Happiness is
    complex, rich, deep and simple. Happiness is near term and long term. Happiness is hedonic and
    eudaimonic.</p>
<p>Happiness encompasses all of life, it is provocative and emotional. It helps people identify what makes
    them happy and gives them the tools to enable them to build their own daily happiness routine. In other
    words it is a great conversation starter, connector and motivator. Everyone has their own ideas about
    happiness and everyone is right. Happiness shifts motivation from extrinsic to intrinsic because we care
    about our personal happiness (WIIFM). Happiness is an enabler; increasing communication, positive
    energy, optimism, health, creating better connection and relationships and improving an organizations
    culture and performance. Happiness improves peoples foundation enabling them to struggle well,
    building grit and resilience. Happiness is complimentary and accelerates the employee focused
    programs that you are already using.</p>
<p>Happiness Expert Sonja Lyubomirsky defines happiness as "The experience of joy, contentment, or
    positive well-being, combined with a sense that one's life is good, meaningful and worthwhile."</p>
