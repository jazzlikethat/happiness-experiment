<h5>Avoiding the Happiness Traps.</h5>

<p>Above is a list of some of the biggest Happiness trap. My personal favorite is: “When I
    get…, then I will be happy.” I lived this for close to 50 years. When I get that new car, then I
    will be happy. When we go on that vacation to Paris, then I will be happy. When I get that
    big promotion and huge raise, then I will happy. In each case I was happy for a split second
    but then the happiness faded, someone else was driving a nicer car or talking about their
    glamour vacation, someone else received a bigger promotion and raise.</p>
<p>It is only when you start to look within yourself and outside of yourself that you find true
    happiness. As Zig Ziglar said “I believe that I can get anything that I want out of life if I just
    help enough other people get what they want.”</p>

<p><b>Action:</b>Write down what you believe to be the biggest happiness traps in your spiral
    notebook. Revisit them often, they are valuable clues for you on your way to happiness and
    success.</p>
