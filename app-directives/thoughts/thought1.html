<h5>Starting questionnaire – Subjective</h5>
<p>There is an old adage that “You get what you measure.” As such, the purpose of the Happiness Experiment is to inspire and help you build more happiness in your life so we would like to start with 2 happiness questionnaires.</p>
<p>Please take your time and answer the questions as truthfully as possible.</p>
<p>Please pay attention. Some of the questions are reverse scored meaning that if you answer with a low number it will count as a higher score. Ex 1 = 6, 2 = 5. And if you answer with a high number it will count as a lower score. Ex. 6 = 1, 5 = 2. For example, Question #1 is scored in reverse: “I don’t feel particularly pleased with the way I am.” If I strongly agree with this statement and answer a 6, it will count as a 1 on the happiness score. </p>
